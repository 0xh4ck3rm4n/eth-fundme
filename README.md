# 💸 FundMe Smart Contract

A decentralized crowdfunding smart contract built with **Solidity**, **Foundry**, and **Chainlink Oracles**.  
This project allows users to fund the contract with ETH, enforces a **minimum USD funding requirement**, and ensures that **only the contract owner can withdraw funds**.

---

## 📖 About

The **FundMe** contract enables:

- ✅ Funding ETH (converted to USD using Chainlink Price Feeds).
- ✅ Enforced minimum funding requirement of **$5 USD**.
- ✅ Tracking of all funders and their contributions.
- ✅ Withdrawals restricted to the **contract owner only**.
- ✅ Gas-efficient withdrawals for optimized performance.
- ✅ Direct ETH acceptance via **fallback** and **receive** functions.
